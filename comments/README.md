1. Most of the pending work or improvements is in the notes folder, the first thing would be to create a file for each of the components used, each component is within the same file for a matter of time, but the ideal would be to have each component within a folder with their respective styles and unit tests, the test would be missing for each of the files, the logic part could be simplified in some parts, for example the edit functionality works but does not show the current note to edit. On the other hand, the design and layout is in general something that could be improved a lot (UI)

2. For the case of converting classes to functions, it is working as expected.

3. For the dark-mode, basically a class is added to the parent class of the application and everything else is handled only with css, a theme was made that changes the colors and takes care of the contrast
